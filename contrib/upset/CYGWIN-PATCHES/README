upset
--------------------------------
upset and the Cygwin perl modules are based on the cygwin-internal 
upset version by Christopher Faylor's, for which he refuses to 
accept patches and replaced by the better genini.
mksetup is loosely based in the version from Yaakov Selkovitz.

INSTALL

fix some options at the head of /usr/sbin/mksetup

cd /usr/src
mkdir setup; cd setup

# put your unmaintained contrib packages here
mkdir contrib

# put your maintained release packages here
mkdir release

# symlink setup.exe into the current dir
ln -s <path>/setup.exe setup.exe

USAGE

Move your setup.hint, binary and src tar.bz2 into the correct setup/release/<package> subdir

mksetup --help

"mksetup" will update the local setup.ini and warn about syntax errors
or missing dependencies.

"mksetup setup" will run setup.exe with your local repository added.
So you can test the package before requesting a upload.
